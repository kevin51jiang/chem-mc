# Chem Multiple Choice Generator

Built on Vox's [Quiz Generator](https://github.com/voxmedia/quiz-generator), but with a few additions/modifications so that it would load compeltely through https.

It also now requires 5 choices for every question, as opposed to the 4 supported by Vox. 

Instructions on how it is used will be made in the near future.
